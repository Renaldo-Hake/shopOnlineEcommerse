## What is Shop Online?
Shop online is a simple, easy to use eccomerse web site. The site only has 10 hardcoded products. There is no back end technologies used to give backend functionality.
This is simply to display an ecommerce from a front end view.

## How does Shop Online work?
Shop Online works just like any other ecommerce where you can add products to the cart, remove and checkout your items in the cart. The total will be displayed in the 
cart page and the checkout page. There is a coupon on the cart page that the user can fill in and a promo code will be given to the user via an alert, this promo code
can be used to reduce the total price on the checkout page. Once the user completes the checkout page the cart will be emptied and the total will be zero.

## Who will use Shop Online?
Anyone who wishes to use this project as a learning project. It is not recommended to use this project in a real life situation as there is a lot of improvement that 
still needs to be done, there is also no backend so the ecommerce is not complete.

## What is the goal of Shop Online?
The goal of Shop Online is to disply the skills I have learned so far using Javascript, CSS and HTML. It will also serve as a ecommerce page that will be improved as I 
improve my skills.
